Here are various benchmark results for different computers:

| Computer              | Native Python (milliseconds) | `ismain` (milliseconds) |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Intel Core i7 3.47GHz | 0.002                        | 50.825                  |

While the ratios are large, the absolute times are fairly small, indicating that for many practical applications,
the performance of `ismain` may be acceptable for most applications.
